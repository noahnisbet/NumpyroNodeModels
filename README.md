**This package automatically builds large numpyro models through a class structure rather than the traditional pyro/numypro model function.**

# **Installation**
---
1. Make sure you have the following packages installed: 
jax, numpyro, funsor, numpy, sklearn, pandas and arviz. 
  
2. Clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/noahnisbet/numpyronodemodels.git`

3. From inside the numpyronodemodels directory execute:

`python setup.py install --user`

Optionally you can omit --user to install for all users.
